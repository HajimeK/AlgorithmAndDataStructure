Computing complexity with Big-O notation

|Task | Big-$O$ | |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Task0.py | $O(1)$ | consistennt as independento of the size|
|Task1.py | $O(n)$| Linear as it goes through both lists in the for loop, and not go through any lists in it. |
|Task2.py | $O(n)$| Liniear as it goes through the calls, and not go through any lists in it.  |
|Task3.py | $O(n\log n)$| It goes list twice, first in for loop, and second in converting list to set. But after that, it runs sorting, which contributes most to computation, $n\log n$.  |
|Task4.py | $O(n\log n)$| It goes list twice, first in for loop, and second in converting list to set. But after that, it runs sorting, which contributes most to computation, $n\log n$.  |
